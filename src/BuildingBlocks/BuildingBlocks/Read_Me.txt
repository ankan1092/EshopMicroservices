### About BuildingBlocks Library  

The **BuildingBlocks** library provides reusable components and shared resources to enhance development efficiency and consistency across microservices.  

#### Key Highlights:  
- **Common NuGet Packages**:  
  - Includes frequently used NuGet packages, pre-configured for ease of use.  
  - Ensures consistency across services by centralizing package management.  

- **CQRS Interfaces**:

  - Simplifies command and query handling across microservices.  

- **Shared Dependencies**:  
  - Centralized repository for dependencies that are common across services.  
  - Reduces duplication and improves maintainability.  

- **Microservice-Friendly**:  
  - Specifically designed for use in distributed systems and microservices architectures.  

This library is an essential toolkit for creating scalable, maintainable, and consistent microservice solutions.
